# Challenge Summary
Create a brand new PseudoQueue class. Do not use an existing Queue. Instead, this PseudoQueue class will implement our standard queue interface (the two methods listed below), but will internally only utilize 2 Stack objects.

## Challenge Description
Create a pseudo queue imitating enqueue and dequeue methods using two stacks and stack methods.

## Approach & Efficiency
Beginning with a stack of three values (10, 15, 20) respecitively,we pushed/enqueued an additional value (5) onto a stack. Needed to return the value (20) on the bottom of the stack, we then peaked and popped our way to a new stack; dequeueing stack1 and enqueing stack2, until (20) was returned at the top of stack2. 

## Solution
saved the image as an invalid file type. need to redraw.
