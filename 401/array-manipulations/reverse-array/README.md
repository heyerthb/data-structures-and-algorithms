# Reverse an Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Write a function that takes in an array and reverse the values in the array returning an array with reversed values.

## Approach & Efficiency
I knew that I needed to find the last value in the array so I thought I should write a method that would iterate through the array from the end, pushing indexes into a new array from the first one. Moving back to front.
